        <h2>Shreya Shah</h2>
        <p>My name is <u>Shreya</u>, and I was born on July 21st, 2011. Currently 14, I'm a freshman at <strong>Lane Tech</strong>,
            but prior to that I attended <strong>Goudy Technology Academy</strong> for 11 years. I've went there since the 
            age of 3 to 13 at 8th grade. During my time at Goudy, I joined clubs like Rock Band, Bike Club,
            and more. I've only ever been on one team there, and it was the esports team in 8th grade. We 
            ended up getting 3rd place in city championships. I also attended the School of Rock back in 
            Edgewater. It was a private school and there I took drum lessons. Although, I left when I 
            reached 7th grade. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When I started going to Lane, I left most of the things I did in middle school due to graduation.
            Here at lane I joined some teams like Drumline and Honor Guard in JROTC. I might join Science 
            Olymiad but I'm a little on the edge for that. Outside of school I teach kids lion dancing at a 
            organization called <em>Chinese Mutual Aid Association</em>, CMAA for short. I went there when I was in 1st
            grade and left after graduation. During my time there, I started going to lion dance practices for
            my interest. Now I'm back there teaching kids what I learned when I was their age. Now I'm also 
            thinking more about the future and what field I want to work in, which is the medical field.
