        <h1 class="heading">goat curry</h1>
        <div class="div1" id="text">Goat curry, also known as "khasi ko masu" in Nepali, is a traditional dish that is
            mainly served during festivals in Nepal. The dish itself is interwined with the 
            agriculture of the country. In Nepal, rearing goats is a common thing villagers 
            have done for years. Over time families started to come up with recipes including
            goat. The use of local spices and herbs is an important aspect of the dish's 
            history, with each region having its variations. The process of cooking the dish 
            itself is a cultural tradition in many Nepali families, often passed down through 
            generations.
